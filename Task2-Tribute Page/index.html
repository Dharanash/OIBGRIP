                  <h4 class="card-title">Born to Burn</h4>
                  <p class="card-text"><b>Elon Reeve Musk</b> ( born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and 
                    product architect of Tesla, founder of The Boring Company and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth

                    <h5>Learning to Grow</h5>
                    <p>Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, where he grew up. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. 
                        Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal.
                         The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online 
                        bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002, for $1.5 billion.
                        In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he serves as CEO and Chief Engineer.
                         In 2004, he was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors.</p>
